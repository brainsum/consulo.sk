## About

Drupal 8 startertheme based on core's Classy base theme. Build process powered
by [Gulp.js 4](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) and asset
files (sass, css, js) structured, linted and compiled according to Drupal Coding
Standards. You can equally run build processes by gulp commands or npm scripts.

## Installation

You will need **node.js**, **npm**, **gulp-cli (min 4.0.0)** globally installed
to working with this startertheme.

```bash
cd {project}/web/themes/custom/
git clone git@github.com:brainsum/drupal8-startertheme.git
cd drupal8-startertheme
npm install
```

## Usage

We use here Gulp.js 4 as task runner. You can run the gulp tasks directly with
gulp, like `gulp sassDev` or with package.json's scripts: `npm start` or
`npm run start`. In both you can choose from the following tasks:

```bash
start # run development version sass, scripts then watch and BrowserSync
prod # run production version sass and scripts. You must run it before commit
sassDev # run development version sass; no watch, BrowserSync in this way
sassProd # run production version sass
sassLint # Linting sass files
scripts # run scripts task; no watch, BrowserSync in this way
```

In Gulp.js there is some extra tasks too. **Before you can run a BrowserSync
task, you need to edit `proxy` setting in `browserSyncTask`!**

## Structure

Theme's structure based on Drupal 8 coding standards and theme recommendations:

* `css` directory: for all compiled css files (not commit map files)

* `fonts` directory: for webfonts

* `images` directory: for all theme images and graphics

* `js` directory: for all JavaScript files*

* `node_modules` directory: we need install all required frontend vendor libraries here

* `sass` directory: Source sass files

* `templates` directory: all twig templates in Drupal module based structure

* `vendors` directory: all production needed vendor libraries used from here

### Sass structure

We use SMACSS and ITCSS here for structuring all sass files. We gave numbers too
for category order:

* `1.settings`: all settings file

* `2.tools`: general mixins and sass functions

* `3.base`: css reset and element (html5 tags) styling

* `4.layout`: all grid and page layout related things

* `5.components`: reusable blocks (try to use it more and more)

* `6.utilities`: utility helper classes; mostly from `2.tools`

To theming pages and __unique__ blocks we use `theme.scss` file. All files and
some directories are empty, just show how you should organize sass files.
The created files mostly just samples, you can add and remove them as project
needs.

### JavaScripts structure

Our all JavaScript files will go to `js` directory. We work from `src` directory
and place the compiled js files to `dist` directory.

### Vendor libraries

If you need a third party css/sass/js library and you want use it as library
(don't merge it our src files): install it with npm to `node_modules`, then
just run the `copyVendorsTask` from gulp.js. (It's in default/start and prod
tasks too.) It will be search dist version of library and copy it to `vendors`
directory.
For example __Font Awesome 5 Free__ library added to `dependencies` and run
`vendors` task. You can see, it has been copied from `node_modules` to `vendors`
directory. It's just for demonstration purposes, you can remove it.

## Coding Standards

### General Rules

First of all, we use Drupal's [.editorconfig](https://github.com/brainsum/static-boilertemplate/blob/master/.editorconfig)
for basic code styling.

All comments in Sass, PHP and JavaScript files must be in [Doxygen](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/css/css-formatting-guidelines#comments)
format. See details in our Wiki.

### SASS/CSS Coding Standard

#### SASS/CSS Coding Style

Coding Style is based on [Drupal's CSS Coding Standard](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/css).
We must use Doxygen comments, [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing)
architecture and [BEM](http://getbem.com) or [BEMIT](https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) syntax schemes. In this theme we used [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/)
for structure Sass too as it's working perfectly with SMACSS.

#### SASS/CSS Linting Tools

All rules checked by **[Stylelint](https://stylelint.io)** from Drupal 8's core
(removed all rules that needed only for Drupal projects). There are Stylelint
plugins for all popular IDE/code editor, but also there is linting task in
builder tool too. Some rules can be fixed via CLI, but the most need manual
work (You will get only warning messages.).

_Another tool_: **[CSSComb](http://csscomb.com/)**. However it's an almost dead
project (only maintained, but no any new features in the future), only a few
(12) rules supported (Stylelint has more than 160 + plugins), but it can autofix
everything and sorting CSS rules.
Recommended to run it manually before commit a Sass file. It has IDE/code editor
plugins too. CSSComb config based on Drupal's [CSSCombx](https://github.com/drugan/csscombx)
config, but updated to latest version and added new css properties.

Currently there aren't a "perfect" tool, so there are some caveats:

* **stylelint-no-browser-hacks** _Stylelint plugin_ has been removed because it
  has incompatibility issue with Sass variables (originally its developed for
  vanilla CSS, Sass linting only with plugin).

* **no-unknown-animations** _Stylelint rule_ has been removed because it's not
  support Sass `@mixin`, `@import` rules (they must be same file and same level).

* **CSSComb** doesn't support multiline property values (after it we need
  realign them).

* **CSSComb** could fail when a file started with comment blocks (temporary need
  to remove them, then paste back).

* However **Stylelint** has sorting plugins, they can't make any changes in
  files, only warning us for about wrong order, so we need still use CSSComb for
  that. (Run CSSComb on a file then fix reported issues by Stylelint.)

* There are some new/edge css properties what **CCSComb** currently doesn't
  support, You must add them to `.csscomb.json` and rerun CSSComb, otherwise
  there will be an empty newline, what will be cause an error/warning in
  Stylelint (and css coding standard).

### JavaScript Coding Standard

#### JavaScript Coding Style and Tool

JavaScript coding style based on [Drupal's JavaScript coding standard](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/javascript).
For linting we use **[ESlint](https://eslint.org)**. The ESlint config based on
[Drupal's core ESlint config](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/javascript/eslint-settings),
witch is based on Airbnb's React ESlint config. Because there isn't any React
and ES6, we removed all rules that related directly to them and switched to
`airbnb-base/legacy` config for ES5 (and below).
